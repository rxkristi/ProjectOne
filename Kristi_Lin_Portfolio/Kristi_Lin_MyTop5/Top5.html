          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2xvtxDNInKDV4AvGmjw6d1?si=1035fca5e06c4726"> <li> Bladee </li> </a>
            <img class="png1" src="img/bladee.png" alt="Bladee 8,027 scrobbles">
            <h3 class="hidden">8,027 scrobbles</h3> 
            <h3 class="hidden">This is my #1 artist. If you know, you know. If you don't, this is Bladee, a member of a cloud-rap collective named Drain Gang. The group of artists curated their own genre and sound known as "drain" to many fans. </h3>

           <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/67lytN32YpUxiSeWlKfHJ3?si=EspaCRF2TveSD6UGwG3ePQ"> <li>Yung Lean</li> </a>
           <img class="png1" src="img/lean.png" alt="Yung Lean 2,560 scrobbles"> 
           <h3 class="hidden">2,560 scrobbles</h3>
           <h3 class="hidden">Yung Lean is highly affiliated with Drain Gang, although he has gained more mainstream traction over the past decade. His underground beats, outlandish lyrics, and vaporwave visuals popularized his name in the 2010's after being viral on YouTube. He has worked on projects with Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, Frank Ocean, and Gucci Mane to name a few.</h3>

           <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6hG0VsXXlD10l60TqiIHIX?si=QBhS1p3pTSKsgfXyscJFhg"> <li>Ecco2k</li> </a>
           <img class="png1" src="img/ecco.png" alt="Ecco2k 2,510 scrobbles"> 
           <h3 class="hidden">2,510 scrobbles</h3>
           <h3 class="hidden">Probably my all-time favorite artist, Ecco2k blends experimental pop and rap, featuring post-status-quo vocals and production to curate new sounds that many fans may find androgynous. He is 1/3 members of Drain Gang. His portfolios are ever-changing, constantly ebbing and flowing to produce stimulating and personal experiences. </h3>

           <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2ApaG60P4r0yhBoDCGD8YG?si=tfC2Ja60Q1uA-HyHwg17wg"> <li>Elliott Smith</li> </a>
           <img class="png1" src="img/elliott.png" alt="Elliott Smith 1,665 scrobbles"> 
           <h3 class="hidden">1,665 scrobbles</h3>
           <h3 class="hidden">Rest in peace Elliott Smith. A legendary alt-rock-folk musician who arose in the 90's and continues to be remembered today. </h3>

           <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb?si=LxANyPgSTf2NDkSIEZaq0g"> <li>Radiohead</li> </a>
           <img class="png1" src="img/radiohead.png" alt="Radiohead 1,612 scrobbles"> 
           <h3 class="hidden">1,612 scrobbles</h3>
           <h3 class="hidden">This band was my most-listened to artist for a while during quarantine (alongside Bladee) and I hold them dearly in my memories and heart. I also enjoy Thom Yorke's solo work.</h3>

            <h3 class="hidden2">Again, this is a fairly short album that I could not stop replaying. But each album has a different feel to it and this one brings me confidence.</h3>

            <h3 class="hidden2">This came out during quarantine. I would often listen to this album while contemplating what colors to wear, how to layer my clothes, and what jewelry to pair. </h3>
