        <a href="https://www.acnestudios.com/us/en/home"> <h2 id="acne">∷⋆⊰ Acne Studios ⊱⋆∷</h2> </a>
        <img class="image" src="img/acne.png">
        <h4 class="inspiration">I am <em>endlessly</em> inspired by a handful of fashion brands, models, and designers, but Acne Studios has always stood out as one of the leading fashion companies I follow. It is a Stockholm-based brand that has a multidisciplinary approach to fashion; the founder, Jonny Johansson, incorporates photography, art, architecture, and contemporary culture into magazines, luxury clothing, and exhibitions. I discovered this brand through a few of my favorite artists who modeled for Acne, as well as seeing their $300 chunky mohair scarves trending on my social media pages a while ago. I went into one of their stores for the first time and it was glamorous. The floor had pink carpeting, there were stylish lounge chairs, and I saw my dream bag face-to-face. They also have a section on their website about their values in becoming a more sustainable brand, claiming "around 70% of our collections are created using preferred organic, recycled or responsibly sourced materials." They have a goal of reaching 100% by the start of the 2026/2027 season's collection. I highly appreciate everything about this brand's style, goals, and relevance to the communities I have interest in.</h4>

        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aloegarten/?hl=en"> <h2 id="ecco">∷⋆⊰ Ecco2k ⊱⋆∷</h2> </a>
        <img class="image" src="img/ecco.jpg">
        <h4 class="inspiration">This is my <strong>favorite</strong> artist of all time. Ecco2k is one of three members in the Swedish cloud rap collective known as Drain Gang, which fostered its own genre of music known as “drain” through its diehard fanbase. His solo work consists of a blend of experimental pop and rap, featuring post-status-quo vocals and production to curate new sounds. Many fans may find him very androgynous as he experiments with his vocals and fashion and makeup, often breaking stereotypes through his appearance. His social media presence has a cult-like following, with fans all over the world. I used to be one of the diehard fans a few years ago, but I continue listening to his music every once and then. The image presented of him is from a photoshoot/interview for 032cLinks to an external site.'s magazine, one of my favorite shoots he's done. Ecco2k has collaborated with Acne Studios on various occasions as well!</h4>

        <a href="https://happy99.online/"> <h2 id="happy">∷⋆⊰ Happy 99 ⊱⋆∷</h2> </a>
        <img class="image" src="img/natdom.webp">
        <h4 class="inspiration">Happy99 is another fashion label, except I am more inspired by their website design. Nathalie and Dominic are New York-based and had just recently opened a flagship store last year. I've been following their social medias for a while and they are definitely the most humorous and adorable couple I follow in the design field. All of their graphics and 3-D visuals are produced by Nathalie, which she'll occasionally post work-in-progress updates for the Happy00 websites on her personal Instagram story. The style of the website resonates to me with FRUiTS Magazine's Harajuku street style outfits (also a big inspiration) through its youthful, animated, and nostalgic web user interface. Overall, I love the creators and I love the projects they bring to life.</h4>
