                <h4>Kristi was born and raised in San Francisco and is now a Visual Communication Design major at San Francisco State. She is currently in her second year now, although she studied as a biology major during her first year. She still loves science, but always had a deep passion in media arts as a career. She is fond of anything related to fashion design, cinema, food, and music.

                Ideally, Kristi would love to work in each field for however long and whenever it speaks to her. She has been working at the Exploratorium since 2021 and believes it is the reason for her natural curiosity and quick “acts of noticing.” Without that position, she can't say she would have been as observant in the world as she is now.

                The intersection of arts and science is like magic to her. From color theory, shadows, light, illusions, and even emotions, we get to play with the world. Science, Kristi personally believes, is about connecting all of the ideas that are evidently true and being able to understand how life on Earth operates. In that, there is an opportunity to expand what we think we know through playing and experiment- that both science and arts require.

                Communication is also a component of both art and science. It requires thorough and considerate thought to fully convey a message. As a visual designer, she often has to look through the lens of anybody else but herself. She is excited to familiarize herself with the tools she needs to succeed throughout the three introductory design courses she is taking this Spring 2025.
